teaser: Deploy your applications using Docker and Rancher
description: |-
  Running containers in production requires a wide variety of technologies, which must be integrated and managed throughout their lifecycle. A powerful tool like Kubernetes requires a lot of expertise to install and manage.

  Rancher is a complete container management platform that makes managing and using containers in production really easy.
 
  Get started with Rancher! Connect a Docker host and start deploying your own applications.

      We are creating a Rancher server and a Docker host, that you can connect
      to the Rancher server. This may take a while...
  assignment: |-
    To start, connect the agent to the Rancher server. Follow these steps:

    - On the Rancher server webinterface, click **Add a host**
    - Change the server address to **http://rancher:8080**
    - Follow the rest of the wizard, and you should have an agent connected

    Now try to deploy a **stack** on this host. Good luck!
